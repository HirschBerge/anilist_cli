# CLI Anime Info tool powered by Rust and AniList

This project plans to be a simple CLI front-end for [Anilist](https://anilist.github.io/ApiV2-GraphQL-Docs/) that allows you to know what is in your library.


## Plans

- [x] Choose Show and specify entry from AniList
- [ ] CLI search flag
- [ ] Search subdirectories given a directory
- [ ] UI? see also [#1](/../../issues/1)
- [ ] Some invalid IDs returned by API. Work around. See also #2
